Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

   The CMake utility is used to guess correct values for your system.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. make sure cmake >= 2.6 is installed on your system

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `cmake ./' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `cmake' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You may prefer to build a package for your system,
     you can do it using cpack: `cpack ./' will produce DEB and RPM
     packages. (you'll need rpmbuild for RPM package).

  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `cmake' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `rm CMakeCache.txt'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
`cmake' does not know about.  See cmake documentation for more
information on how to set those variables.
